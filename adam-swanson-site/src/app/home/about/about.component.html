      Hello! I'm a software developer who's looking to help others and make a difference.
      <br><br>
      I'm a recent graduate of Indiana Tech with a BS degree in Software Engineering and a minor in Math. I currently
      work as a developer at Aptera where I'm constantly growing and working with a variety of technologies.
      <br><br>
      In my spare time, I develop and maintain a website for a local non-profit organization, and I work on several of
      my own open-source projects. I'm also looking for ways to share my knowledge with others and help people learn
      from my experiences.
