      Hello! I'm a software developer who's looking to help others and make a difference.
      <br><br>
      I'm a recent graduate of <a href="https://www.indianatech.edu/" target="_blank">Indiana Tech</a> with a B.S. degree in Software Engineering (summa cum laude) and a minor in
      Math. I currently
      work as a developer at <a href="https://www.apterainc.com" target="_blank">Aptera</a> where I'm constantly growing
      and working with a variety of <a (click)="navigate('skills')">technologies</a>.
      <br><br>
      In my spare time, I develop and maintain a <a href="https://illianaantiquepower.com" target="_blank">website</a>
      for a local non-profit organization, and I work on several of
      my own open-source projects which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/theaswanson"
        target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I'm also sharing my knowledge with
      others and helping people learn
      from my experiences through my <a href="https://blog.layerseven.net" target="_blank">blog</a>!
      <br><br>
      If you have any questions or would like to connect, please <a href="mailto:layersevenmail@gmail.com">email me</a> or message me via <a href="https://twitter.com/crisp2020" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
